# Step 1. Your First Pulumi Program

You will learn how to create a new Pulumi program using our Pulumi templates,
specifically for `GCP` with TypeScript.

Create a new directory called `pulumi-challenge` and run the following inside of it:

    pulumi new gcp-typescript

# Step 2. Creating Your First Resource

Now that we have a base GCP project configured, we need to create our first resource.
In this instance, we’ll create a new GCS bucket which will allow us to store our static website.
We’ll also ensure that this bucket is private.

    TODO(): create Bucket code possibly using GCP Native library for `TS`.
