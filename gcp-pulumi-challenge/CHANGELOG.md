2022-09-30 ricc v0.6 Added `uniformBucketLevelAccess` to bucket. Now it should work alone, and refactored bucket vs
                     object access in two possibly exclusive booleans (fior now both true). Also moved bucket
                     to EU because why not. Diversity, right?
2022-09-30 ricc v0.5 Fixed the public IP for objects (making GCS bucket public wouldnt suffice)
2022-09-29 ricc v0.4 Created LB thanks to Roberto and make it work - apart from public state of objects
